        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Meri, a senior at Michigan State University. Two years ago, I graduated from Lansing Community College with a degree in Studio Art. While some may view art as an unconventional career choice, I’ve discovered that my observational and creative skills serve me well every day. I currently balance my time between working at Michigan State and Goldfish Swim School. I’m also in the process of applying to graduate schools to pursue a career in Software Engineering—wish me luck!</p>
        <p>Here at two fun facts about me:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>I enjoy driving around listening to music</p></li>
            <li><p>I am not a great driver</p></li>
        </ol>
