            <p>I vividly remember walking through movie rental stores. The Blockbuster in my area was just a five-minute drive down the road, and I can still hear my brother and sister bickering over who got to pick the movie. On good weeks, when my family was doing well, we would go to Blockbuster, Family Video, or the occasional Redbox vending machine and pick two movies to watch that week. The aisles were tall compared to me and filled with plastic containers featuring intricate cover art that would catch your eye and make you want to watch them. The carpets were usually dirty, and most of the time, it smelled like old pot from the worker behind the counter, but my younger self didn’t care. I wanted to run through the candy aisles and grab sugar-filled treats that would make me feel ill because I would eat them too fast.</p>

            <p>Today, this is not the standard for kids who want to watch a show. In an article written by Morné Visagie, “The Death of Video Stores: A World of Magic Lost to Convenience,” the author mentions the magical feeling of being young and picking out your movie in person. <a href="https://medium.com/@mornevisagie/the-death-of-video-stores-a-world-of-magic-lost-to-convenience-b2c9c44f2423"> read more about it here.</a></p>

            <h2>I Am Making Art.</h2>

            <p>I had an appointment with my dermatologist a few weeks ago, and I noticed a some things:
                <ol>
                    <li>I was by far the youngest person in the waiting room.</li>
                    <li>Older people go to doctor visits together, and it's very endearing.</li>
                    <li>Waiting in the lobby feels like one of the longest times in your life.</li>
                </ol>

            <p>In the article “The Art of Waiting” by Rodrigo S-C, the author shares his personal experience at the doctor's office. As you might expect, Rodrigo mentions that patients usually keep to themselves and spend time on their phones, which is why he does the exact opposite. Inspired by a two-minute video of artist John Baldessari, in which he strikes small poses in front of a blank wall and shouts “I am making art” repeatedly, Rodrigo is motivated to pass the time by taking photos of ordinary items around the office, claiming them as art. One thing that stood out to me while reading this was that the author mentioned that artists are the best at killing time. <a href="https://medium.com/full-frame/the-art-of-waiting-d2cafdbcd635">Read the article here</a> and form your own opinion on whether you agree that this is art.</p>
